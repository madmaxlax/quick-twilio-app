Project: Develop an application to message users via Twilio
=====



Requirements:

1. Users can create and manage user profiles with the following required fields: First Name, Last Name, Mobile Number
2. Users can send sms via Twilio to the people saved in the application either individually, or in groups.

Notes: 
* Start the app on the main page. Do not worry about a home/marketing page.  
* Please include a README with any setup instructions or other details you would like to share with the reviewers.   
* Don't feel like you have to toil for days, generally a few hours across a day or two should be PLENTY!
